## Known & Existing Bugs
### 1. OrderQueue Display @ Restaurant End
#### Description: The only way to refresh/update the OrderQueue Display at Restaurant End is to add a new order in dialog page, i.e. append a new order to orderqueue, other buttons such as "REFRESH" in restaurant page, "HURRY" in mainwindow page, "FINISH" in restaurant page will not trigger refresh the display. However, the internal queue structure is modified as desired, to view any changes made by above bottons, please submit a new order in dialog end.
#### Trigger: Press "SUBMIT" button at dialog UI
#### Potential Reason: The problem with the internal orderqueue pointer structure, during debugging, the signal/slots works as expected.
### 2. Order Generation @ Entire System
#### Description: When generating a new order, i.e. pressing + - button in dialog page, it is ok to make the items display on the right changes as desired, and it is also ok to create a new order by "SUBMIT" botton that contains a dish that has never been added before. However, after the order is submitted, the items display on the dialog page will not clear, and the dishs ordered before must exist at least one. For example, if you have two coffees in the item display, and you submitted this order, when you are trying to create another new order by pressing "submit", you can delete one coffee, but you must leave one in the display, otherwise the system will crash. This bug applies to other dishes too. Super weird bug, limited lots of functionality.
#### Trigger: Press "SUBMIT" button at dialog UI
#### Potential Reason: UNKNOWN
